ArchItUp is creative platform for new architects and students of architecture that want to introduce themselves to the public. 
Itâ€™s a place where they can show their projects, write and read interesting articles, discuss architecture, share knowledge with others, 
find out about workshops and lectures they can attend or test their skills on different competitions. Main focus is to help new architects 
to present themselves, gain confidence and teach them how to sell themselves.
